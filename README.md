# TLS4Developers Workshop

In addition to the TLS4Developers Workshop you find some exercises here to get a little more hands-on.
You might want to use them to practice at home.

## Prerequisites

You need a machine running Linux (or maybe MacOS) as your playground

   * This could be your local workstation or needs to be reachable by network from your workstation.
   * The playground machine needs internet access.
   * OpenSSL and Apache Webserver with mod_ssl enabled need to be installed in a recent version.
   * You need to be able to configure and restart the Apache webserver there. If you have root access, this is easy. Other permissions to do so are absolutly fine too!
   * The exercises might work on MacOS too, but maybe need to be adapted. They have been created and tested on Linux - so if you are looking for the easy way: Go for Linux.
   * Single exercises maybe depend on additional prerequisites. They are named there.

__@ToDo:__ write something about vagrant here

## Getting started

   * Clone this Git repository on your playground machine and jump to the exercise you are interested in

## Exercises

   * [__Exercise 1__](exercises/1/):
     Establish a connection between HTTPS server and client with a selfsigned certificate
